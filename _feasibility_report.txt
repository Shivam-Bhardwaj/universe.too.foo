Building a Browser-Based Astronomical Visualization System: Technical
Feasibility Report
A SpaceEngine-class universe viewer running entirely in WebGPU is technically achievable today. This report
synthesizes cutting-edge research across five critical domains—neural compression, spatial indexing,
uncertainty representation, catalog fusion, and browser streaming—revealing that all core technologies have
reached production-ready maturity, though integration at astronomical scale presents significant engineering
challenges.

Executive summary for decision-makers
The convergence of three technological breakthroughs makes this project viable now: 3D Gaussian Splatting
compression achieving 100× data reduction with minimal quality loss, WebGPU compute shaders rendering 2
billion points interactively in browsers, kitware and HEALPix-based streaming proven at scale by the Gaia
mission's 1.8 billion star catalog. The highest technical risks involve cross-browser WebGPU support (Firefox
still experimental) and mobile GPU limitations rather than fundamental feasibility. Estimated development
timeline is 8-12 months to production-ready system, with data preparation pipelines requiring 6-9 months of
parallel development for multi-catalog fusion.

Neural compression enables efficient universe streaming
The state of the art in 3D Gaussian Splatting compression has advanced dramatically since 2023, with HAC++
achieving 100× compression versus vanilla 3DGS while actually improving visual quality. This breakthrough
from TPAMI 2025 uses hash-grid assisted context modeling with learned entropy coding, compressing typical
scenes from 734 MB to just 8.7 MB at the low-rate setting.
For browser deployment, vector quantization methods offer the optimal tradeoff between compression ratio and
decompression speed. Compact3D (ECCV 2024) achieves 45× compression using K-means clustering during
training, storing small codebooks that enable O(1) GPU lookups at runtime. Ucdvision LightGaussian from
NeurIPS 2024 takes a complementary approach, pruning 60% of Gaussians through global significance scoring
while distilling spherical harmonics to lower degrees.

WebGPU implementations already exist. Niedermayr et al.'s Compressed 3DGS runs in browsers using
Rust/WebGPU, achieving 4× higher framerates than compute-only pipelines through hardware rasterization.
The Shanghai AI Lab's Visionary engine achieves 2-16ms per frame on RTX 4090, demonstrating that realtime performance is achievable.
The critical limitation is entropy decoding. While vector quantization decompresses trivially (codebook
lookup), advanced entropy-coded methods like HAC++ require CPU-side arithmetic decoding at ~100-500ms
for million-scale scenes. For streaming, this suggests a hybrid approach: use aggressive offline compression
with simple VQ for browser-side decompression, targeting 20-50× compression rather than maximum ratios.

HEALPix and octrees provide proven spatial indexing at scale
Indexing billions of astronomical objects requires hierarchical spatial structures that support both 2D sky
queries and 3D distance-aware visualization. Wallaby-survey HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude
Pixelisation) has become the de facto standard for astronomical data, underpinning Gaia, Planck, LIGO/Virgo,
and the IVOA's HiPS streaming protocol.
HEALPix divides the celestial sphere into 12 base-resolution curvilinear quadrilateral pixels, with each level
subdividing into 4 children. At NSIDE=8192, this yields ~800 million pixels with sub-milliarcsecond precision.
The NESTED numbering scheme preserves spatial locality, making it ideal for database indexing and
progressive streaming.
Gaia DR3 exemplifies production-scale implementation: source_id encodes HEALPix level-12 index in bits
36-63, partitioning 1.8 billion stars into ~3,386 level-8 ranges of ~500,000 sources each. This enables efficient
spatial queries through cell intersection and consistent partitioning across all tables.
For 3D visualization with distances, octrees complement HEALPix. The Potree system has proven that
browsers can render 597 billion points using octree-based streaming with screen-space error metrics. GPUaccelerated octree construction achieves 1-4 billion points per second, with memory-efficient encoding storing 1
billion points in just 8GB.
The recommended architecture uses HEALPix for 2D sky tessellation (leveraging HiPS infrastructure)
combined with octrees for 3D distance-aware LOD:
Hybrid Index Structure:
├── healpixIndex: HEALPixTree // For 2D cone searches, catalog streaming
└── octreeIndex: Octree

// For 3D navigation, distance-based LOD

Performance studies comparing HTM versus HEALPix at billion-object scale show that hardware I/O
throughput dominates over indexing algorithm choice—focus engineering effort on CDN architecture and
compression rather than optimizing index algorithms.

Uncertainty must drive level-of-detail decisions
Astronomical measurements carry inherent uncertainty that varies dramatically with brightness and distance.
Gaia DR3 parallax errors range from 0.02-0.03 mas for bright stars (G<15) to 1.3 mas for faint sources (G=21),
meaning fractional distance errors exceed 20% for approximately 80% of the catalog. This uncertainty must
inform visualization decisions.
The fundamental challenge is that parallax errors do not propagate linearly to distance errors. The inverse
relationship d = 1/ϖ creates systematic Lutz-Kelker bias: random parallax errors preferentially scatter toward
larger distances because more volume exists at greater distances. Simple parallax inversion produces biased
distance estimates for most stars.
Bailer-Jones probabilistic distance estimation addresses this through Bayesian inference, combining parallax
likelihoods with direction-dependent Galaxy model priors. The resulting posterior distributions yield
asymmetric confidence intervals (r_lo, r_med, r_hi) that properly capture distance uncertainty. These estimates
are pre-computed for Gaia DR3 and should be used directly.
Gaia provides a full 5×5 covariance matrix for astrometric parameters (α, δ, ϖ, μα*, μδ) through 10 correlation
coefficients. Propagating this to 3D Cartesian coordinates via Jacobian transformation yields an uncertainty
ellipsoid whose orientation and semi-axes represent positional confidence.
For LOD systems, we propose a combined importance score:
Importance = w₁×Distance_score + w₂×Quality_score + w₃×Brightness_score
where:
Distance_score = f(1/d_screen)

// Closer = more important

Quality_score = f(ϖ/σ_ϖ)
// Well-measured = more important
Brightness_score = f(20 - G_mag)/20 // Brighter = more important

Objects with high quality scores (ϖ/σ_ϖ > 5) receive full geometric detail including uncertainty ellipsoids;
uncertain objects (ϖ/σ_ϖ < 2) display as blurred points or aggregate into density fields. This allocates rendering
budget to data that justifies the precision.
Uncertainty visualization research from IEEE VIS provides established techniques: color/opacity mapping
(uncertain → transparent), size variation (larger = more uncertain), blur/texture effects, and animated sampling
from posterior distributions. Li et al.'s 2007 TVCG paper specifically addresses astrophysical data, proposing
ellipsoid models with unified color-coding for log-scale distances.

Mature tools enable multi-catalog fusion
Combining Gaia, 2MASS, WISE, and planetary ephemerides into a unified schema requires cross-matching
algorithms that handle positional uncertainty, epoch differences, and heterogeneous photometry. The toolchain
is mature and well-documented.
Positional cross-matching has evolved from simple nearest-neighbor to probabilistic frameworks. The
foundational Budavári & Szalay (2008) Bayesian approach computes Bayes Factors comparing the hypothesis
that sources originate from the same object versus chance alignment. For Gaussian positional errors, the
astrometric Bayes Factor is analytically computable. The NWAY algorithm (Salvato et al. 2018) extends this to
N-way matching across arbitrary catalog combinations, achieving 94-99% reliability. ADS
The CDS X-Match service handles billions of sources using HEALPix indexing u-strasbg and Apache Spark,
with support for per-row positional errors. STILTS/TOPCAT, developed by Mark Taylor over 20+ years,
provides comprehensive local processing with epoch propagation via the epochProp function. Astropy's
coordinate matching uses SciPy k-d trees for efficient nearest-neighbor searches.
Epoch differences pose a critical challenge. Gaia DR3 uses J2016.0, while 2MASS observations span J19992001. High proper motion stars can move >1 arcsec between epochs. Solutions include:
STILTS epochProp function for Gaia position propagation
CDS provides Gaia in both J2016.0 and epoch-precessed J2000.0 versions
Gaia Archive pre-computed cross-matches include proper motion correction
Error propagation when combining measurements follows standard formulas. Number Analytics For positional
matching with circular errors: σ_total = √(σ₁² + σ₂²). Epoch propagation adds proper motion uncertainty: σ_α(t)
= √(σ_α₀² + (t-t₀)² × σ_μα²). Systematic effects include Gaia parallax zero-point (~-17 μas) and proper motion
bias for bright stars.
Schema design should follow IVOA standards using VOTable format with UCDs (Unified Content
Descriptors) for semantic column identification. Preserve original catalog identifiers, match separation and
probability, all photometric bands with errors, and epoch information.
For solar system objects, JPL Horizons provides authoritative ephemerides for 1.4M+ asteroids, 4000+ comets,
and all planets. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Integration requires time-resolved queries: for each observation
epoch, query Horizons for predicted positions, then flag as distinct source type in the unified schema.

WebGPU streaming architecture achieves billion-point interactivity
Browser-based streaming of massive point clouds has been proven at scale. Potree renders 597 billion points in
web browsers using octree-based LOD streaming, and VTK's WebGPU implementation demonstrates 2 billion
points interactively on a single workstation. kitware
The Potree 2.0 format uses just three files: metadata.json (structure), hierarchy.bin (octree layout), and
octree.bin (all point data with Brotli compression). This 10-50× reduction in file count versus v1.7 dramatically
accelerates conversion and reduces HTTP overhead.
3D Tiles (OGC Community Standard since 2019) provides a complementary approach for heterogeneous
geospatial data. Version 1.1 supports point clouds via glTF with EXT_mesh_features for metadata, using
geometric error metrics for LOD selection. The screen-space error calculation determines refinement: SSE =
geometricError × screenHeight / (distance × 2 × tan(fov/2)).
WebGPU compute shaders enable 10× performance gains over traditional GL_POINTS rendering for large
point clouds. The technique uses atomic operations (atomicMin with interleaved depth+color) for visibility
determination, kitware achieving:

Bandwidth optimization relies on hierarchical caching and view-dependent streaming. Compressed
astronomical data requires 2-4 GB for static billion-point datasets (LAZ compression). Interactive streaming
demands 10-100 Mbps depending on navigation speed. HTTP/2 multiplexing reduces latency by 16-71%.
ResearchGate

Browser caching uses Service Worker + IndexedDB architecture. The Cache API stores HTTP tile responses
(50-500MB Safari, 80% disk Chrome), while IndexedDB persists processed geometry and metadata. LRU
eviction manages quota constraints.
Geometry streaming versus pixel streaming strongly favors geometry for this application:
Offline capability essential for field astronomy
Low latency critical for interactive exploration
CDN scaling is 10,000× cheaper than GPU server rental
Static astronomical data is highly cacheable
Pixel streaming only makes sense for security-sensitive data or devices without WebGPU support.

Recommendations for project execution
The technical foundation supports a viable path to production. We recommend:
Compression strategy: Start with Compact3D-style vector quantization (45× compression, trivial decode),
reserving advanced entropy coding for server-side optimization. Target 20-50× compression with conservative
pruning—astronomical features can be subtle.
Indexing architecture: Deploy HEALPix (NESTED) for 2D sky tessellation, leveraging existing HiPS
infrastructure and CDS catalogs. Add octree indexing for 3D visualization with distances, using Potree-style
streaming.
Uncertainty integration: Compute quality scores (ϖ/σ_ϖ) and use Bailer-Jones distances. Allocate rendering
detail proportional to measurement confidence. Reserve ellipsoid rendering for nearby, well-measured stars; use
blur/transparency for uncertain objects.
Streaming implementation: Adopt Potree 2.0 format with custom WebGPU renderer using compute shader
rasterization. Target 60fps at 100M visible points, with Service Worker caching for offline access.
Catalog pipeline: Use pre-computed Gaia cross-matches where available (2MASS, WISE), STILTS for custom
regions with epoch propagation, and NWAY for probabilistic multi-catalog fusion. Preserve full provenance in
unified schema.
The convergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting compression, WebGPU compute capabilities, and proven
astronomical data infrastructure creates a genuine opportunity to build SpaceEngine-class visualization in the
browser. The technology is ready; the challenge is engineering integration at scale.
